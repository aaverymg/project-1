# project-1
A twitter bot, inspired by Christopher Strachey's love letter generator
Twitter's character limit restricts the amount of nuance that a tweet can convey, which leads to completely nonsensical political positions. Avbot is meant to parody this phenomenon. This project is not radical software- I'm just here to poke fun at the absurdity.

Made by Avery M-G for the class "Radical Software", Eugene Lang College, Fall 2021
